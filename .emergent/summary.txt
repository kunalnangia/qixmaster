The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the IntelliTest AI automation platform. The initial phase focused on understanding the existing codebase and applying mandatory configurations to the frontend and  files, including , , and . A comprehensive plan was then formulated, spanning five phases from backend migration to advanced enterprise features. The engineer commenced with Phase 1, migrating the backend from Supabase to FastAPI/MongoDB and integrating OpenAI, as confirmed by the user. This involved creating new backend models, database utilities, schemas, CRUD operations, and authentication logic (, , , , ), and updating . Dependencies like usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]
              [-o ORGANIZATION] [-t {openai,azure}]
              [--api-version API_VERSION] [--azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT]
              [--azure-ad-token AZURE_AD_TOKEN] [-V]
              {api,tools,migrate,grit} ...

positional arguments:
  {api,tools,migrate,grit}
    api                 Direct API calls
    tools               Client side tools for convenience

options:

  -v, --verbose         Set verbosity.
  -b API_BASE, --api-base API_BASE
                        What API base url to use.
  -k API_KEY, --api-key API_KEY
                        What API key to use.
  -p PROXY [PROXY ...], --proxy PROXY [PROXY ...]

  -o ORGANIZATION, --organization ORGANIZATION
                        Which organization to run as (will use your default
                        organization if not specified)
  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.
                        'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning'
  --azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT
                        The Azure endpoint, e.g.
                        'https://endpoint.openai.azure.com'
  --azure-ad-token AZURE_AD_TOKEN
                        A token from Azure Active Directory,
                        https://www.microsoft.com/en-
                        us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-
                        id
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit and usage: websockets [--version | <uri>] were installed. Backend testing revealed a 400 Bad Request error for user registration, which is the immediate priority for the next step.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to transform the IntelliTest AI test automation product into a scalable, robust, and enterprise-ready application with a full-stack architecture (frontend, backend, database). The existing application, initially using Supabase, needs its backend logic built out with FastAPI and an optimized MongoDB schema.

Key enhancements explicitly requested by the user, drawing inspiration from platforms like Testsigma, Mabl, and Katalon, include:
-   **Unified Live Dashboard (USP 3.2.2):** Merging Dashboard and Analytics into a central hub for test run status, pass/fail rates, and a real-time feed of team comments.
-   **Collaborative Test Review (USP 3.2.3):** Implementing a real-time commenting system on each test case for team collaboration.
-   **Natural Language Test Debugging (USP 3.6.3):** An Analyze Failure button that uses AI to provide plain-English explanations and suggested fixes for failed tests.
-   **Contextual Test Prioritization (USP 3.1.3):** A Smart Prioritize feature where AI re-ranks test cases based on provided context (e.g., The login UI was updated).
-   **AI Features & Testing Types End-to-End Functionality:** Implementing all AI features and various testing types (functional, visual, API, security, performance, cross-browser, cross-device).
-   **Agentic Automation Platform:** Designing agents for complex integration challenges, scalability, dynamic data handling, and limited learning capabilities.
-   **Self-healing Techniques, Flow Recorder, Generative Agents:** For autonomous creation, diagnostics, maintenance, and workflow planning.
-   **Seamless Integration Capabilities & User-friendly Interfaces:** Alongside comprehensive analytics reporting.

The AI engineer's plan reflects these requirements, focusing on backend migration, AI integration, collaborative features, advanced testing, and enterprise functionalities.

  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.

  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit Python library, along with  and usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], has been installed and added to .
3.  **Core Backend Models & Logic**: New Python files (, , , , ) have been created.
    *   : Defines the MongoDB document structures for users, test cases, test plans, etc., using UUIDs for IDs.
    *   : Handles the asynchronous connection to MongoDB.
    *   : Defines Pydantic models for data validation.
    *   : Contains functions for database interactions (creating, reading, updating, deleting data).
    *   : Implements user authentication logic, including JWT token handling and password hashing.
4.  ** Update**: The main FastAPI application file () has been significantly updated to incorporate these new modules and expose initial API endpoints, specifically for user registration and potentially other core functionalities.

**Current State of Product**: The backend is running, and new database models, CRUD operations, and authentication logic are in place. OpenAI integration is set up. However, upon backend testing, the user registration endpoint () returned a  error, indicating an issue with the authentication/registration flow. This is the immediate blocking issue that needs resolution.
